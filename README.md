# Happy Thoughts
This was a project built during the Technigo bootcamp. The project consisted in building a twitter-like page where the user should post only happy thoughts.
The purpose was to learn about:
- How to use APIs in React, firing requests withinÂ `useEffect`.
- How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
- What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.
